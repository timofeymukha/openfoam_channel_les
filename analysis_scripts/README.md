# Analsys scripts

The scripts can be split into two categories.

1. Start with `compute_`, demonstrate how to compute various turbulent statistics from probe data. The script names should be self-explanatory.

2. Start with `post_`, post-process results and produce figures. 

Additionally, there is the `prepare_porbes.py` that generates the probes at the coordiantes of the face centers of a patch.
